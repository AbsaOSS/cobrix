package za.co.absa.cobrix.cobol.parser.headerparsers

/**
  * This trait represents a contract for record header parsers. Usually each record of a multi-segment mainframe file
  * has a 4 byte record descriptor word (RDW) header specifying length of each record. If this RDW header is no-standard
  * a custom header parser can be provided to Cobrix to extract such records.
  *
  * To this you need to create a parser class that extends this trait and implement the header parser logic.
  * Each concrete class inherited from this trait should be serializable because it need to be transferrable to
  * executors when used from Spark framework.
  *
  * So the usual way implementing a custom record header parser is
  * `extends Serializable with RecordHeaderParser`
  *
  * A record header parser for RDW is implemented in `RecordHeaderParserRDW`. This is a good starting point
  * for implementing your own record header parser.
