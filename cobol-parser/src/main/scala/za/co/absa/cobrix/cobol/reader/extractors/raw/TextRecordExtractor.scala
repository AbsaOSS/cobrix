/**
  * This implementation of a record extractor for ASCII test files.
  *
  * Record extractors are used for in situations where the size of records in a file is not fixed and cannot be
  * determined neither from the copybook nor from record headers.
  *
  * Empty likes (ones that contain only LF / CRLF) are skipped.
  *
  * The implementation is optimized for performance, so might be not obviously readable.
  * Hopefully, comments will help anyone reading this.
