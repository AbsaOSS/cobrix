            # Historically, 'cobol-parser' module was part of 'spark-cobol' and the coverage is combined.
            # Jacoco can't combine coverage across modules, so until 'cobol-parser' has unit tests
            # that covers the same codepade from the same module, the coverage requirement is lowered to 20%.
